## Wheel of Fortune - 1836
Oregon Trail themed Wheel of Fortune game. This is a three player game where each player has a chance to guess the word puzzle, spin the wheel, guess a consonant, or buy a vowel to eventually try and solve the puzzle for that round.

On the first page, players will be prompted to choose their names. They will then be redirected to the rules page. After reading the rules, they enter the game-page and player one gets to begin the game! Each of the three players compete in 3 rounds to solve a word puzzle. At the start of each round, players start with zero gold. If a player guesses the puzzle correctly, that player has their round total added to their total score. If a player buys a vowel, they have 10 gold subtracted from their round score. The player with the most points at the end of round three, will go on to a bonus round where they have a chance to win an Oregon trail themed prize!
